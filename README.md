# Zumobot

## Project
We programmed a zumobot to follow a black line. The bot uses 4 sensors that give information on the surface reflection. 
We used that and the motor use range to form a quadratic equation that the bot followed.
It wasn't the fastest robot in our course but it went through the track more smoothly than the others.
